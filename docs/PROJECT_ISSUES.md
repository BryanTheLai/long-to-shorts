# Project Issues Overview

This is the consolidated issue inventory for this repo as of **2026-04-22**.
It separates:

- **Confirmed runtime gaps**: current code does not do the desired thing.
- **Open backlog**: desired capabilities that are documented but not built.
- **Doc boundaries**: where the repo intentionally mixes runtime truth, design history, and roadmap.

Read this after [`PIPELINE.md`](PIPELINE.md) if you want the blunt picture.

## Executive summary

The biggest current product gaps are:

1. **Clip selection is still transcript-only.** Visual context does not influence which windows survive Stage 2.
2. **Stage 3 still emits one merged layout per clip.** Multi-frame sampling exists, but there is no layout timeline when a 60s clip genuinely changes structure mid-run.
3. **Upload metadata is still dead weight.** `shorts_title`, `description`, and `hashtags` are stored but not consumed by the product pipeline.
4. **Hook windows still do not change the render in-point.** They protect pruning, not final clip start.
5. **There is still no automated canonical-video integration test.** The Cathie Wood regression was verified manually, not by a committed end-to-end test.

Important shipped changes that are **no longer open issues**:

- Stage 3 now samples **multiple frames per clip**.
- The model-facing bbox contract is now **0..1000**, normalized back to internal `[0,1]`.
- Structured LLM calls now use **`response_schema`** at the provider boundary.
- Stage 3 fallback now preserves **`clip.layout_hint`** instead of collapsing chart-heavy clips to `sit_center`.
- Layout cache invalidation now keys off **clip windows**, not arbitrary `clips.json` byte changes.

## A. Confirmed runtime gaps

| ID | Issue | Evidence | Why it matters |
|----|-------|----------|----------------|
| R1 | **Clip selection has no visual context.** | [`src/humeo/pipeline.py`](../src/humeo/pipeline.py) still runs Stage 2 before Stage 3; there is no `narrative_context.json` pre-selection artifact. | The selector cannot use chart appearances, slide OCR, or scene structure when choosing highlight windows. |
| R2 | **Stage 3 collapses to one clip-level layout.** | [`src/humeo/layout_vision.py`](../src/humeo/layout_vision.py) samples multiple frames and merges them into one `LayoutInstruction`; render consumes one instruction per clip. | If a clip changes from talking head to chart reveal halfway through, the pipeline still has to choose one dominant layout. |
| R3 | **Hook windows do not change export start.** | [`src/humeo/render_window.py`](../src/humeo/render_window.py) narrows export bounds only with trims; hook fields are not render inputs. | If product intent is "start exactly on the hook sentence", current code does not do that. |
| R4 | **`shorts_title`, `description`, and `hashtags` are persisted but unused.** | The fields exist on [`humeo-core/src/humeo_core/schemas.py`](../humeo-core/src/humeo_core/schemas.py), but the render pipeline does not read them. | Model tokens are spent on metadata that never affects render or export. |
| R5 | **No automated canonical-video regression test.** | The Cathie Wood Azure rerender was verified from real outputs and logs, but no committed end-to-end test exercises that path. | The exact demo source that caught the Stage 3 bug is not yet part of automated regression coverage. |
| R6 | **Stage 3 quality still depends on local frame sampling working.** | [`src/humeo/layout_vision.py`](../src/humeo/layout_vision.py) requires `cv2` to sample frames; when sampling fails it now falls back safely to `layout_hint`. | The product no longer breaks catastrophically, but quality still drops if sampling dependencies are missing or the source cannot be read. |

## B. Open backlog that is documented but not built

These are not hidden bugs. They are openly documented next capabilities that are still missing.

| ID | Backlog item | Where documented | What is missing |
|----|--------------|------------------|-----------------|
| B1 | **`narrative_context.json` before clip selection** | [`docs/TODO.md`](TODO.md) | No Stage 1.5 visual-summary artifact yet; Stage 2 still depends only on transcript plus hashes. |
| B2 | **Clip selector consumes visual context** | [`docs/TODO.md`](TODO.md) | No prompt or cache input today changes when the source visuals change but the transcript does not. |
| B3 | **Layout timeline / per-segment layout output** | [`docs/TODO.md`](TODO.md), [`docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS_AND_PROMPT_CONTRACT_GAP.md`](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS_AND_PROMPT_CONTRACT_GAP.md) | Multi-frame evidence is merged to one clip-level answer; there is no time-varying layout plan yet. |
| B4 | **Cross-episode memory module** | [`docs/SOLUTIONS.md`](SOLUTIONS.md), [`docs/TODO.md`](TODO.md) | No memory/state layer beyond one work dir and its caches. |
| B5 | **Automated canonical-video integration fixture** | [`docs/SOLUTIONS.md`](SOLUTIONS.md), [`docs/TARGET_VIDEO_ANALYSIS.md`](TARGET_VIDEO_ANALYSIS.md) | No committed regression harness for the real target source. |

## C. Doc boundaries

These are not bugs. They are the intentional boundaries between different doc types:

| ID | Boundary | What to treat as truth |
|----|----------|------------------------|
| D1 | **`PIPELINE.md` is runtime truth.** Other docs may describe design intent or historical plans. | Use [`PIPELINE.md`](PIPELINE.md) when you need to know what the code runs today. |
| D2 | **`TODO.md` is partly historical.** It contains design proposals, some of which have now shipped in partial or full form. | Use the status snapshot at the top of [`TODO.md`](TODO.md), not the whole file, for current-state interpretation. |
| D3 | **`SOLUTIONS.md` mixes history with current invariants.** | Treat it as design rationale plus guardrails, not the canonical pipeline spec. |
| D4 | **`KNOWN_LIMITATIONS_AND_PROMPT_CONTRACT_GAP.md` is issue-focused, not a feature overview.** | Use it for prompt/runtime mismatches and fix maps, not onboarding. |

## D. Clear current-state picture

If you want the shortest accurate description of the project **today**, it is:

1. **What works today**
   - Ingest, transcript, structured clip selection, hook detection, content pruning, multi-frame layout vision, subtitles, and ffmpeg render.
   - Split layouts preserve chart geometry again after the 2026-04-22 Stage 3 fallback fix.
   - Stage LLMs are provider-swappable across `gemini`, `openai`, and `azure`.
   - There are unit/component tests around ranking, caching, bbox parsing, layout planning, CLI behavior, and rendering primitives.

2. **What is still weak today**
   - Clip selection still cannot see visuals before choosing clips.
   - Layout decisions are still one-per-clip rather than time-varying.
   - Some LLM-generated metadata fields still never reach a product surface.
   - The canonical demo source is still verified manually rather than by automation.

3. **What to fix first if output quality is the priority**
   - Add pre-selection multimodal context.
   - Replace one merged layout per clip with a layout timeline when a clip has real visual changes.
   - Either consume or remove dead upload metadata fields.
   - Add a real canonical-video regression harness.
